# HabenyanDB
Simple DB I'm trying to make for FGO KR.


Don't know if anyone would come to see this right now but hi. 

Just a beginner trying to do something. Probably will have lots of inefficient code. Also files are a big mess...


Working on how to get the description data. Will probably make a new json file with only relevant data to use later.

BTW Habenyan is cute.
